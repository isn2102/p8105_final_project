### Project Title

**Mapping Community Gardens in New York City**


### Motivation


### Intended Final Products


### Anticipated Data Sources

Our primary data source will be the "NYC Greenthumb Community Gardens" dataset from NYC OpenData.

### Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges


### Planned Timeline




## INSTRUCTIONS

### Submissions
Other than peer assessments, each deliverable will appear online (as e.g. a GH repo or youtube video). Links should be submitted via Courseworks by one team member (not necessarily the same person for each deliverable).

### Team registration and proposal
First, you will define your teams and propose a project. This proposal should be a half-page to a page in length and include:

* The group members (names and UNIs)
* The tentative project title
* The motivation for this project
* The intended final products
* The anticipated data sources
* The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
* The planned timeline
* There should be one proposal per group, written collaboratively using .Rmd (rendering to a GH document) in a dedicated GitHub repo. Conceptually, this is intended to review a project that is 10% complete.
