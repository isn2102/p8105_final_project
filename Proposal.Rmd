### Project Title

**Mapping Community Gardens in New York City**


### Motivation

New York City is known for its towering skyscrapers and "concrete jungle". However, in more recent years, there has been a push to advocate for more green spaces. Starting in the 60s, vacant lots have been transformed into usable open space with the help of local residents, ultimately becoming the Community Garden movement in the 70s with the help of the Green Guerillas. These gardens offer residents an escape from the hustle of the city while providing a sense of ownership and stability in the rapidly changing city.

This project hopes to explore the distribution these community gardens and their relationships with the surrounding neighborhoods and residents. We hope to explore the geographic location of the gardens and proxmity to different racial and economic clusters. 

### Intended Final Products
Our final project will be a website, consisting of a main landing page with a brief introduction and overview of the project and the collaborators involved. 
Further, we will have a report depicting any associations with community garden locations and frequency with other variables such as median income in the neighborhood, age, and race. 


### Anticipated Data Sources

* Primary data source will be [NYC Greenthumb Community Gardens](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/NYC-Greenthumb-Community-Gardens/ajxm-kzmj)
* Further neighorhood demographic data from [NYU](https://furmancenter.org/neighborhoods)


### Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges
We plan to provide a leaflet map overlaying the location of the gardens throughout the boroughs in New York. We also hope to show a few other plots through shiny or a dashboard.

We anticipate there may be coding challenges when we merge datasets. If the data is not coded consistenly or with similar variables, it may be difficult to combine the datasets that we need in order to answer our research questions. 


### Planned Timeline

* November 7: Proposal
* November 10-13: Project review meeting
* November 14-20: Work on the report
* November 21-27: Work on the webpage and screencast
* November 28-December 5: Edit and finalize report, webpage and screencast, complete peer assessment
* December 6-10: Prep for in class presentation/discussion!




## INSTRUCTIONS

### Submissions
Other than peer assessments, each deliverable will appear online (as e.g. a GH repo or youtube video). Links should be submitted via Courseworks by one team member (not necessarily the same person for each deliverable).

### Team registration and proposal
First, you will define your teams and propose a project. This proposal should be a half-page to a page in length and include:

* The group members (names and UNIs)
* The tentative project title
* The motivation for this project
* The intended final products
* The anticipated data sources
* The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
* The planned timeline
* There should be one proposal per group, written collaboratively using .Rmd (rendering to a GH document) in a dedicated GitHub repo. Conceptually, this is intended to review a project that is 10% complete.
