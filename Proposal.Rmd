### Project Title

**Community Gardens in New York City: planting the seed of urban growth**  
**Community Gardens in New York City: cultivating urban activism and ownership**

### Background

With its reputation as the "concrete jungle," New York City is known for its towering skyscrapers and bustling streets. However it also has a long and vibrant history of urban agriculture and green space cultivation. After the economic crisis and disinvestment in the 1970s, many areas of the city saw a surge in abandoned buildings and vacant lots that were turned over to the city through foreclosure. The activist group Green Guerillas saw the opportunity to reinvest in their neighborhood and reclaim these lots as green spaces for the community. This grew into a larger movement of community gardeners, with the city leasing lots to community gardens and providing support through the creation of the GreenThumb program in 1978. Despite the gardens' successes as important cultural and community institutions, there was continual pressure from the city to turn gardens into housing developments. Over the years, community members and organizations have come together to fight for, preserve, and develop new gardens for the wider community despite these pressures. 

There are now over 500 community gardens throughout New York City. These gardens provide a sense of ownership and stability in the rapidly changing city. They offer residents a calm escape, a space to come together with community members to solve local problems, and a connection to local food production. In addition to the value they bring to individuals, community gardens have embedded themselves in the fabric of New York City neighborhoods and have impacted areas as diverse as property values, community activism, and health. 

This project aims to further explore the relationship between community gardens and the people and fabric of NYC neighborhoods by asking four main questions: 
1. How are community gardens distributed throughout the city?
2. How are the locations of gardens related to certain demographic characteristics? 
3. What is the relationship between community gardens and economic investment? 
4. What is the relationship between community gardens and select health conditions?

### Intended Products + Website Flow

**Website pages:**  

* Landing page with Title, authors, introduction, research questions, citations (written above), and the map of community gardens (plotly)  
  - Map will be using leaflet and will show the location of individual gardens, with information on each when you hover  
  - Map will also include visual distribution (or small side graph) of a variable for number of community gardens in each community board / district  
* Page about economic investment (dashboard)  
  - Map of distribution of gardens and maps showing median income, gentrifying status, property values, helpful neighbors, and participatory budget projects  
  - Possibly also small graphs showing above variables  
  - Results from spatial regression or cluster identification to assess the relationship between these variables and community gardens  
* Page about health outcomes (dashboard)  
  - Map of distribution of gardens and maps showing self-reported health, obesity, diabetes, htn, psychiatric hospitalization, premature mortality, life expectancy  
  - Possibly also small graphs showing these variables  
  - Results from spatial regression or cluster identification to assess the relationship between these variables and community gardens  
* Report page  
  - Recap of the background info on the landing page  
  - full description of analytic methods  
  - write up of results from analyses  
  - visualizations found on the other pages  
  - plots showing basic demographic characteristics of each neighborhood: age distribution, race distribution, population size, education distribution
  
**Analysis**  
1. Spatial dependence of gardens (clusters statistically significant / not normally distributed)  
2. Spatial regression model for economic indicators (choose one or two)  
  - Can use property values by interpolating and summarizing at community board level, or median income/gentrification value for each community board, or create a composite variable for average participatory budgeting amount per location  
  - Adjust for covariates: race, age  
3. Spatial regression model for health indicators (choose one or two)  
  - Can use the value for each community board  
  - Adjust for covariates: race, age, income

### Data Sources

* Primary data source will be [NYC Greenthumb Community Gardens](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/NYC-Greenthumb-Community-Gardens/ajxm-kzmj)
* Demographic & health data by community board from [nyc.gov](https://communityprofiles.planning.nyc.gov/)
* Property value data from [Revised property value notices](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Revised-Notice-of-Property-Value-RNOPV-/8vgb-zm6e)
* Participatory budgeting project tracker from [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Participatory-Budgeting-Project-Tracker/qm5f-frjb)

* If needed for additional neighborhood demographic data: [NYU](https://furmancenter.org/neighborhoods)

### Questions

### Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges - remove section?? 

We plan to provide a leaflet map overlaying the location of the gardens throughout the boroughs in New York. We also hope to show a few other plots through shiny or a dashboard to help visualize the distribution of gardens and the relationship to the other variables of interest. These variables include the size of the community gardens and whether they have any relationship to boroughs and/or other geographic markers across the city. Furthermore, in the data source looking across community districts (https://communityprofiles.planning.nyc.gov/), there is a variable that assesses the accessibility to parks. We are also potentially interested in looking at park accessibility by key demographic and geographic variables. Analyses will include regression models to assess if number of community gardens in a certain location is associated with property values / median incomes and other demographic variables. Further association between investment from the city for local projects with gardens will be explored.

We anticipate there may be coding challenges when we merge datasets. If the data is not coded consistently or with similar variables, it may be difficult to combine the datasets that we need in order to answer our research questions. We also anticipate there may be challenges with missing data in certain key variables, which we will have to deal with the in data cleaning/tidying phase of the project. 

### To Do's

Clean up stuff: 

- play around with theme for dashboards
- Make sure the global graph settings are all the same
- How to get back to main page from dashboards? 
- Names at bottom of site
- Icons for menu
- Remove floating menu
- Change color theme
- Home page stuff


Main page: 
images of gardens + motivation + what youâ€™ll find here (short)
menu: 
home
garden distribution - shiny (two visual views, one showing either map of garden points or map of garden number by community board and the other one showing demographic characteristics with drop down)
drop down visualization
